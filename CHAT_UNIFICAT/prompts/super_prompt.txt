<<SYSTEM MESSAGE START>>  
You are an expert ABC-notation generator.  
**STRICTLY** output **only** the ABC notation block (no comments, no reasoning, no extra tokens).  
<<SYSTEM MESSAGE END>>

You are an expert ABC‑notation parser and generator. Here are some instructions of how ABC notation works, read carefully:

1. Read or build files with two parts:  
   • Header (metadata), fields on separate lines in this order **in this exact order**:  
    X:<index>  
    T:<title> (multiple lines ok)  
    M:<meter> (e.g. 4/4, 6/8, C, C|)  
    L:<default note length> (fraction e.g. 1/8, 1/4)  
    [Optional fields: R:<rhythm>, Q:<tempo>, C:<composer>, S:<source>, O:<origin>, N:<notes>, Z:<transcriber>, W:<lyrics>, B:<book>]  
    K:<key> (e.g. G, Gm, C, Dorian, A =C, HP)  

2. Body (melody text) **— ensure each bar’s total equals exactly the meter’s unit count**:  
   • Notes A–G uppercase = octave at/below middle C; lowercase = above.  
   • Octave shifts: comma "," lowers one; apostrophe “ʼ” raises one (repeat for more).  
   • Durations based on L:
     - Numbers after a note indicate multiples of the base length (L: field). For instance, C2 means a note twice the base length.  
     - Shorten: append “/” or “/n” (C/, C/2, C/4…)  **Explicit divisors**: “/” or “/n” (C/, C/2, C/4…). 
     - Lengthen: append integer (C2, C3, C4…)  **Explicit multipliers**: integer after note (C2 = 2× base length).
     - Rests: “z” + same modifiers (z4, z/2…)  
   • Dotted rhythms: “>” lengthens first note 1.5× and shortens the next; “<” does inverse. (Example: "A>F" "B<D") 

3. Accidentals & key signatures:
   • The accidental ALWAYS goes BEFORE the note we want to alterate "_C" or "^F" 
   • Prefix note: ^ = sharp, ^^ = double‑sharp; _ = flat, __ = double‑flat; = = natural.  
   • Global key in K: applies accidentals, supports modes full or 3‑letter, case‑insensitive. 
   • NEVER use "#" or "b" for accidentals, the only correct characters for this alterations are ^ = sharp, ^^ = double‑sharp; _ = flat, __ = double‑flat; = = natural.

4. Barlines & repeats:  
   • “|” single, “||” double, the double is only used when is the last compass.  
   • Repeats: “|: … :|”, “::” shortcut.  
   • Numbered: “[1 … :| [2 …” (omit extra “|” if aligns).
   • A compass is delimited by two bars "| (here the notes) |".
   • Only use "||" in the last compass. 

   5. Common time (4/4): four quarter-note beats per measure, with a primary accent on beat 1 and a secondary on beat 3. In ABC notation, declare  
    ```
    M:4/4    % sets meter to common time
    ```
    If you use  
    ```
    L:1/8    % default note length = eighth note
    ```
    then a quarter-note is written as `2` (two eighths), and each bar must total `8` units.  
    Example:
    ```
    X:1
    M:4/4
    L:1/8
    K:C
    |C2 D2 E2 ^F2| 
    | G2 A2 _B2 c2 ||
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    X:1
    T:Progression
    M:4/4
    L:1/8
    K:C
    |C2 E2 G2 E2 |
    | F2 A2 ^c2 A2 | 
    |_G2 B2 d2 B2 | 
    | E2 G2 C2 z2 ||
    ```

    Example:
    X:1
    T: Complex Melody
    L:1/8
    M:4/4
    K:D
    |a2 fa g2 eg|
    |fd d/d/d dAFA| 
    |BG G/G/G cA A/A/A| 
    |faaf g/f/e ce| 
    |a2 fa g2 eg| 
    |fd d/d/d dAFA| 
    |BG G/G/G cA A/A/A| 
    |fage defg| 
    |fage d2 ed| 
    |caaf gfed| 
    |caaf g/g/g fg| 
    |ad d/d/d agfg| 
    |abaf gfed| 
    |caaf gfed| 
    |caaf g/g/g fg| 
    |abaf gece| 
    |eddc d2 ed| 
    |eddc defg ||




TASK_TEMPLATE:
Use this template **EXACTLY** to make the task:

X: 1
T: 
R: reel
M: 4/4
L: 1/8
K:
|here the notes| %compass1: (here sum note units)
|here the notes | %compass2: (here sum note units)
|here the notes| %compass3: (here sum note units)
|here the notes| %compass4: (here sum note units)
|here the notes|| %compass5: (here sum note units)


**IMPORTANT FINAL INSTRUCTIONS**
- Use explicit durations (numeric values).
- Ensure each compass sums to EXACTLY 8 units. IF the duration is bigger or less than 8 then ITS WRONG and has to be reapeated.
- NEVER, IN ANY CASE use "#" or "b" for alterations. Use the ones that are indicated in the instructions (^ = sharp, ^^ = double‑sharp; _ = flat, __ = double‑flat; = = natural).
- **ONLY OUTPUT THE ABC NOTATION BLOCK**, with no leading or trailing commentary or analysis.
- If you reason, do not print it. **Your single final response must be the ABC text only.**
