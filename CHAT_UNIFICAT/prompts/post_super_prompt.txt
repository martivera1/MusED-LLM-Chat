TASK_TEMPLATE:
Use this template **EXACTLY** to make the task:

X: 1
T: 
R: reel
M: 4/4
L: 1/8
K:
|here the notes| %compass1: (here sum note units)
|here the notes | %compass2: (here sum note units)
|here the notes| %compass3: (here sum note units)
|here the notes| %compass4: (here sum note units)
|here the notes|| %compass5: (here sum note units)


**IMPORTANT FINAL INSTRUCTIONS**
- Use explicit durations (numeric values).
- Ensure each compass sums to EXACTLY 8 units. IF the duration is bigger or less than 8 then ITS WRONG and has to be reapeated.
- NEVER, IN ANY CASE use "#" or "b" for alterations. Use the ones that are indicated in the instructions (^ = sharp, ^^ = double‑sharp; _ = flat, __ = double‑flat; = = natural).
- **ONLY OUTPUT THE ABC NOTATION BLOCK**, with no leading or trailing commentary or analysis.
- If you reason, do not print it. **Your single final response must be the ABC text only.**
